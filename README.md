# Roblox-pass-changer
Changes your roblox account password

The Python script to change your own Roblox password would involve sending a POST request to the password reset endpoint with the new password included in the payload. 

you should replace "CURRENT_PASSWORD" with your current Roblox password, and ensure that you have logged out of all other devices before changing your password. Remember to use this code responsibly and only with the explicit permission of the account owner.
